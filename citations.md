        abstract = {We present a new library of high-resolution synthetic spectra based on the stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX that can be used for a wide range of applications of spectral analysis and stellar parameter synthesis. The spherical mode of PHOENIX was used to create model atmospheres and to derive detailed synthetic stellar spectra from them. We present a new self-consistent way of describing micro-turbulence for our model atmospheres. The synthetic spectra cover the wavelength range from 500AA to 50.000AA with resolutions of R=500.000 in the optical and near IR, R=100.000 in the IR and a step size of 0.1AA in the UV. The parameter space covers 2.300K{\textless}=Teff{\textless}=12.000K, 0.0{\textless}=log(g){\textless}=+6.0, -4.0{\textless}=[Fe/H]{\textless}=+1.0, and -0.2{\textless}=[alpha/Fe]{\textless}=+1.2. The library is a work in progress and we expect to extend it up to Teff=25.000 K.},

In parallel, low mass planets are being searched around red dwarfs which offer more favourable conditions, both for radial velocity de- tection and transit studies, than solar-type stars. Authors of the model atmosphere code which has allowed the detection of water vapour in the atmosphere of Hot Jupiters re- view recent advancement in modelling the stellar to substellar transition. The revised solar oxygen abundances and cloud model allow for the first time to reproduce the pho- tometric and spectroscopic properties of this transition. Also presented are highlight results of a model atmosphere grid for stars, brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets.},

This grid is also the starting point for a large grid of detailed NLTE model atmospheres for dwarfs and giants. The models were calculated from 3000 to 10,000 K (in steps of 200 K) for 3.5{\textless}=logg{\textless}=5.5 (in steps of 0.5) and metallicities of -4.0{\textless}=[M/H]{\textless}=0.0. We discuss the results of the model calculations and compare our results to the Kurucz grid. Some comparisons to standard stars like Vega and the Sun are presented and compared with detailed NLTE calculations.},
